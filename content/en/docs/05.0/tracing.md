  Tracing in a Microservices Architecture

## Tracing

When it comes to large distributed cloud native system with many different components involved, debugging production issues or even finding a way to display how components interact with each other becomes quite hard and tricky.

This is where tracing comes into the picture. Tracing allows us to collect all sorts of requests in a group of requests, which somehow belong together to a single business transaction.
In our Quarkus applications, we use [Eclipse MicroProfile OpenTracing](https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-opentracing/blob/master/spec/src/main/asciidoc/microprofile-opentracing.asciidoc) to collect the tracing data and [Jaeger](https://www.jaegertracing.io/) as a component where those traces are sent to and been visualised for further analysis.


## Task {{% param sectionnumber %}}.1: Deploy Jaeger instance

Make sure to currently be in your main project (lab 3) where your application and other services are deployed:

```bash
oc project <userXY>
```

Then let's quickly deploy a Jaeger instance.

{{% alert title="Note" color="primary" %}}
This Jaeger deployment is not meant for production use! Data is only stored in memory. In a production environment, there would probably be one Jaeger instance used by multiple Services.
{{% /alert %}}


Create the local file `<workspace>/jaeger.yaml` with the following content:

```yaml
apiVersion: jaegertracing.io/v1
kind: Jaeger
metadata:
  name: jaeger-all-in-one-inmemory
```

[source](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/puzzle/amm-techlab/master/manifests/05.0/5.2/jaeger.yaml)

And then deploy the Jaeger instance.

<details><summary>command hint</summary>

```bash
oc apply -f jaeger.yaml
```

Or let argoCD manage the resources (`git add . && git commit -m "Message" && git push`)

</details><br/>

Expected result:

```
jaeger.jaegertracing.io/jaeger-all-in-one-inmemory created
```

Verify the deployment

```bash
oc get pod -w
```

{{% alert  color="primary" %}}Press `Ctrl+C` to stop the watching of the pods.{{% /alert %}}

The newly deployed Jaeger instance is also available over a route.

```bash
oc get route jaeger-all-in-one-inmemory --template={{.spec.host}}
```

```
jaeger-all-in-one-inmemory-<userXY>.{{% param techlabClusterDomainName %}}
```

Use this URL with https protocol to open the Jaeger web console in a Browser window. Use your techlab user credentials to log in. Ensure to allow the proposed permissions.


## Task {{% param sectionnumber %}}.2: Send Traces to Jaeger

Now let's make sure the traces that are collected within our microservices are also been sent to the running Jaeger services.

To achieve that, we need to deploy a different version of our microservices. Update the deployment config (`consumer.yaml`and `producer.yaml`) to use the new images:

```
puzzle/quarkus-techlab-data-producer:jaegerkafka
puzzle/quarkus-techlab-data-consumer:jaegerkafka
```

Update your resources and apply the changes.

<details><summary>command hint</summary>

```bash
oc apply -f producer.yaml
```

Expected result: `deployment.apps/data-producer configured`

```bash
oc apply -f consumer.yaml
```

Expected result: `deployment.apps/data-producer configured`

Or let argoCD manage the resources (`git add . && git commit -m "Message" && git push`)

</details><br/>

And also reconfigure (change the `quarkus.jaeger.enabled` env to `true`) the data-transformer (`data-transformer.yaml`) to enable Jaeger

```yaml
...
env:
...
- name: quarkus.jaeger.enabled
  value: 'true'
```

<details><summary>command hint</summary>

```bash
oc apply -f data-transformer.yaml
```

Or let argoCD manage the resources (`git add . && git commit -m "Message" && git push`)

</details><br/>


## Task {{% param sectionnumber %}}.3: Explore the Traces

Explore the Traces in the Jaeger Console once again. You should see the data-producer and data-consumer as services.
