## {{% param sectionnumber %}}.1 Lab

The Docker build strategy was already used in [Lab 2](http://localhost:8081/docs/02.0/2.1/containerize/). We don't repeat it here. The Docker Strategy expects a `Dockerfile` at the root of the Project. For every Build it invokes the Docker build command and produces a runnable Image.
